# Description

This is a very simple program I made for a microbiology class I was in and had to do serial dilution calculations for bacteria colony growth and plaque assays for virulence.

The program will ask you, which of the two types of questions you would be facing, whether it be about bacteria or viruses.  This is mostly so the prompts better match how the question is wording itself.

# Requirements

Latest version of Java, which at the time this is being posted is 16.0.1 .
